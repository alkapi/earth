Feature: Data import for AutomobileMakeModelYearVariant
  As a data user
  I want to import MakeModelYearVariant data
  So that I can perform variant-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that year is from 1985 to 2010
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYearVariant" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_variant_good"
    When a data import verifies "Year should be from 1985 to 2010"
    Then the verification should be successful

  # FIXME TODO
  # Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel type code is found in AutomobileFuel
  #   Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYearVariant" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_variant_good"
  #   When a data import verifies "Fuel type code should be found in AutomobileFuel"
  #   Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiencies are greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYearVariant" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_variant_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiencies should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYearVariant" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_variant_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that year is from 1985 to 2010
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYearVariant" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_variant_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Year should be from 1985 to 2010"
    Then the verification should not be successful
