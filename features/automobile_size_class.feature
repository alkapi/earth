# Feature: Data import for AutomobileSizeClass
#   As a data user
#   I want to import AutomobileSizeClass data
#   So that I can perform size class-based calculations
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that annual distance > 0
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Annual distance should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
#   
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that annual distance units are kilometres
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Annual distance units should be kilometres"
#     Then the verification should be successful
#   
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiencies > 0
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiencies should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
#   
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
#     Then the verification should be successful
#   
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that any fuel efficiency multipliers > 0
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Any fuel efficiency multipliers should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
#   
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that fallback fuel efficiency multipliers > 0
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Fallback fuel efficiency multipliers should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that annual distance > 0
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Annual distance should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
#   
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that annual distance units are kilometres
#     Given a "AutomobileSizeClass" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_size_class_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Annual distance units should be kilometres"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
