Feature: Data import for EgridRegion
  As a data user
  I want to import EgridRegion data
  So that I can perform eGRID region-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that loss factor is greater than zero and less than one
    Given a "EgridRegion" data import fetches results listed in "egrid_region_good"
    When a data import verifies "Loss factor should be greater than zero and less than one"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that loss factor is greater than zero and less than one
    Given a "EgridRegion" data import fetches results listed in "egrid_region_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Loss factor should be greater than zero and less than one"
    Then the verification should not be successful
