# Feature: Data import for GreenhouseGas
#   As a data user
#   I want to import GreenhouseGas data
#   So that I can perform global warming potential-based calculations
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that abbreviation and IPCC report are never missing
#     Given a "GreenhouseGas" data import fetches results listed in "greenhouse_gas_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Abbreviation and IPCC report should never be missing"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that time horizon is 100
#     Given a "GreenhouseGas" data import fetches results listed in "greenhouse_gas_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Time horizon should be 100"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that time horizon units are years
#     Given a "GreenhouseGas" data import fetches results listed in "greenhouse_gas_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Time horizon units should be years"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that global warming potential is one or more
#     Given a "GreenhouseGas" data import fetches results listed in "greenhouse_gas_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Global warming potential should be one or more"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that abbreviation and IPCC report are never missing
#     Given a "GreenhouseGas" data import fetches results listed in "greenhouse_gas_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Abbreviation and IPCC report should never be missing"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that time horizon is 100
#     Given a "GreenhouseGas" data import fetches results listed in "greenhouse_gas_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Time horizon should be 100"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
