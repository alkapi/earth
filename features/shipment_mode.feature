Feature: Data import for ShipmentMode
  As a data user
  I want to import ShipmentMode data
  So that I can perform shipment mode-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that route inefficiency factor >= 1
    Given a "ShipmentMode" data import fetches results listed in "shipment_mode_good"
    When a data import verifies "Route inefficiency factor should be one or more"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that route inefficiency factor >= 1
    Given a "ShipmentMode" data import fetches results listed in "shipment_mode_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Route inefficiency factor should be one or more"
    Then the verification should not be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that transport emission factor > 0
    Given a "ShipmentMode" data import fetches results listed in "shipment_mode_good"
    When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that transport emission factor > 0
    Given a "ShipmentMode" data import fetches results listed in "shipment_mode_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should not be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that transport emission factor units is never missing
    Given a "ShipmentMode" data import fetches results listed in "shipment_mode_good"
    When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor units should never be missing"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that transport emission factor units is never missing
    Given a "ShipmentMode" data import fetches results listed in "shipment_mode_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor units should never be missing"
    Then the verification should not be successful
