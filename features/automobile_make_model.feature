Feature: Data import for AutomobileMakeModel
  As a data user
  I want to import MakeModel data
  So that I can perform model-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiences are greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModel" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiencies should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModel" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that fuel efficiences are greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModel" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiencies should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should not be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModel" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
    Then the verification should not be successful
