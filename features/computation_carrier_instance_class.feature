Feature: Data import for ComputationCarrierInstanceClass
  As a data user
  I want to import ComputationCarrierInstanceClass data
  So that I can perform computation carrier instance class-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that electricity intensity is more than zero
    Given a "ComputationCarrierInstanceClass" data import fetches results listed in "computation_carrier_instance_class_good"
    When a data import verifies "Electricity intensity should be more than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that electricity intensity units are kilowatts
    Given a "ComputationCarrierInstanceClass" data import fetches results listed in "computation_carrier_instance_class_good"
    When a data import verifies "Electricity intensity units should be kilowatts"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that electricity intensity is more than zero
    Given a "ComputationCarrierInstanceClass" data import fetches results listed in "computation_carrier_instance_class_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Electricity intensity should be more than zero"
    Then the verification should not be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that electricity intensity units are kilowatts
    Given a "ComputationCarrierInstanceClass" data import fetches results listed in "computation_carrier_instance_class_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Electricity intensity units should be kilowatts"
    Then the verification should not be successful
