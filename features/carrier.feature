# Feature: Data import for Carrier
#   As a data user
#   I want to import Carrier data
#   So that I can perform carrier-based calculations
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that package volume > 0
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Package volume should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that package volume > 0
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Package volume should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that route inefficiency factor >= 1
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Route inefficiency factor should be one or more"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that route inefficiency factor >= 1
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Route inefficiency factor should be one or more"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that transport emission factor > 0
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that transport emission factor > 0
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that transport emission factor units is never missing
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor units should never be missing"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that transport emission factor units is never missing
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Transport emission factor units should never be missing"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that corporate emission factor > 0
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_good"
#     When a data import verifies "Corporate emission factor should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Failing to verify that corporate emission factor > 0
#     Given a "Carrier" data import fetches results listed in "carrier_bad"
#     When a data import verifies "Corporate emission factor should be greater than zero"
#     Then the verification should not be successful
# 
#   Scenario: Successfully verifying that corporate emission factor units is never missing
