Feature: Data import for AutomobileMakeFleetYear
  As a data user
  I want to import MakeFleetYear data
  So that I can perform year-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that year is between 1978 and 2007
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Year should be between 1978 and 2007"
    Then the verification should be successful
  
  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiency is greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful
  
  Scenario: Successfully verifying that volume is greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Volume should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
    Then the verification should be successful
  
  Scenario: Failing to verify that year is between 1978 and 2007
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Year should be between 1978 and 2007"
    Then the verification should not be successful
  
  Scenario: Failing to verify that fuel efficiency is greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should not be successful
  
  Scenario: Failing to verify that volume is greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeFleetYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_fleet_year_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Volume should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should not be successful
