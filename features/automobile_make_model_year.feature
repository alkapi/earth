Feature: Data import for AutomobileMakeModelYear
  As a data user
  I want to import MakeModelYear data
  So that I can perform model year-based calculations

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that year is between 1985 and 2009
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Year should be between 1985 and 2009"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiences are greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiencies should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Successfully verifying that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_good"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
    Then the verification should be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that year is between 1985 and 2009
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Year should be between 1985 and 2009"
    Then the verification should not be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that fuel efficiences are greater than zero
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiencies should be greater than zero"
    Then the verification should not be successful

  Scenario: Failing to verify that fuel efficiency units are kilometres per litre
    Given a "AutomobileMakeModelYear" data import fetches results listed in "automobile_make_model_year_bad"
    When a data import verifies "Fuel efficiency units should be kilometres per litre"
    Then the verification should not be successful
