  # It looks like synthesizing a unique name would require including pretty much every column from the FEGs
  # (e.g. creeper gear, automatic vs automatic with lockup, feedback fuel system, etc.)
  # The advantages of not keying on row_hash is we could update variants to note whether they're hybrid or not and
  # it would let users specify variants. But my conclusion is that trying to do this won't be much of an improvement
  # because it will be a bunch of work to include all the columns and the names will be really long and obtuse
